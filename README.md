# My_Genome
Temporary repository for my powerpoint with notes on my genetic variants associated with atopic dermatits 

## Sequencing 
Sequencing was done through [Nebula Genomics](https://nebula.org/whole-genome-sequencing-dna-test/) 30x whole genome sequencing service 

## Literature Review
Most variants I have checked for are from a 2015 atopic dermatitis GWAS [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26482879/)

## Future Work 
  * Better my general understanding of genetics and statistics  
  * Check variants associated with other immune related diseases
  * Make personal website and incorporate this
